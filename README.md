# To-Do Hyper
To do list app that's designed to help people with ADHD be more focused and on track.

## Objective
Create a to-do list that's meant to help people with ADHD focus on their tasks and become more productive. Web app was designed with notes from my personal frustrations and online research.

## Note
I'll update this app overtime.

Currently, data is stored using the localStorage in your web browser. My goal is to store this in a server so it can be used anywhere.

## Features Implemented to Help with ADHD
As mentioned, these features were designed based on things I would be frustrated with, and what others have said online.

#### Simple Design
- Design is meant to be clutter free and simple
- Goal is to not distract the user

#### Project Completion Percentage
- People with ADHD tend to lose track of their progress
- The completion percentage shows what percentage of sub-tasks they've completed for the main project
- It adds a simple and clear way to view progress on projects

#### Quick Note Button
- People with ADHD tend to have thoughts that quickly come and go
- If they don't write down this idea, they may become stuck trying to remember it and lose sight of whatever it was they were doing
- Users can easily click a button that brings up a menu to add their thoughts, and store into its own folder for review later

#### No Overdue Assignments
- According to users online, people with ADHD tend to be discouraged when they didn't meet a deadline and it says "overdue" on a task

#### One Timer for Everything
- This is also made to prevent people with ADHD from being discouraged
- Users can get overwhelmed if they've pre-assigned several timers to their tasks
- Having a timer that they can use for whatever they want adds flexibility and fluidity to their workflow
